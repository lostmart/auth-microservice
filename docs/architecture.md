# Architecture & Design Considerations

## Microservice Boundaries

- User authentication and authorization
- User registration and credential storage
- Login/logout operations
- Token generation and validation
- Password reset flows
- Possibly refresh token management
- Possibly user profile management

## Technology Stack Assessment

- SQLite as database

- JWT for tokens

- bcrypt for password hashing
